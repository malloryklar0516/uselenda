# Module 1 challenge 1: Code Refactoring for Web Accessbility

In this challenge, I implemented the following user story:
* As a marketing agency I want a codebase that follows accessibility so that our own site is optimized for search engines

# Acceptance Criteria
* It's done when I view the source code and then I find semantic HTML elements
* It's done when I view the structure of the HTML elements and then I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* It's done when I view the image elements and then I find accessible alt attributes
* It's done when  I view the heading attributes and then they fall in sequential order
* It's done whe I view the title element and then I find a concise, descriptive title
